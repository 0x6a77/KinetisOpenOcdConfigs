Getting OpenOCD to work with OSX

Install KDS and Processor Expert (with updates) per Freescale docs.
Install GNU ARM OpenOCD per Freescale
Install MCU On Eclipse PE extensions.
Update KDS via Eclipse update mechanism.
Install GNU ARM OpenOCD (0.9.0) from original web source (update site)

As of 09SEP15:
----------------------------------
Fix the the following libraries:

replace this -> ilg.gnuarmeclipse.debug.gdbjtag_2.1.3.201503181632.jar
with a renamed version of this --> ilg.gnuarmeclipse.debug.gdbjtag_2.2.1.201508190739.jar

The reason for this is that Freescale support for Kinetis only exists (as of this time) in a "special" OpenOCD 0.8.0 unpatched back to the GNU ARM Eclipse project.
We really need to run OpenOCD 0.9.0, but the KDS installer won't fully let us do that because of weird internal dependencies.
Hopefully, Freescale will get the KDS-installed OpenOCD to match the one from the real GNU ARM Eclipse project.
