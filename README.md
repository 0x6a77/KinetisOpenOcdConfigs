# KinetisOpenOcdConfigs

A public copy of the debug configs we use for OpenOCD.  (Our "real" ones live with each of our projects private repos.)

We generally will not maintain these - it's a jumping off point for others who want an easier path to KDS + OpenOCD + [CMSIS-DAP or JTAG]

BTW, in our shop most of us run Macs.  A chunk run Linux.  We have one irascible holdout who insists on running Windows.
